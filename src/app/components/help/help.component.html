        <p *ngIf="join">
          Join is a bussiness-oriented tool that focuses on helping a team (or
          an individual) keep track of business projects. The application offers
          the possibility of a summarized overview through the "Summary"
          section, followed by a more detailed area, such as the "Board"
          section. If it is necessary to insert additional tasks for the team,
          the team leader has the possibility to create them via the "Add Task"
          section or directly on the "Board" section. In addition, the "Contact"
          section offers the possibility to store the contact data of the
          members individually.

          The Summary page provides an overview of all your tasks listed by
          categories: To-do, In Progress, Await Feedback, and Done. For each
          category, the number of tasks in that category is displayed.
          Additionally, the oldest task with its corresponding date (upcoming
          date) is displayed on the home page. This way, you always have a quick
          overview of your upcoming tasks.

          This opens a detailed view where you can edit or delete the task. It
