      restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether
      by automated means or not.

    <p>
      The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about
      the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of
      such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We
      also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize
      our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third
      parties also processing data they collect and control.
    </p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>
      I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The rights of
      users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data processing
    </p>
    <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
    <p>
      The party responsible for this website (the „controller“) for purposes of
      data protection law is:
    </p>
    Marco Scherf<br />Sonnenallee 16<br />16321
    <p>Telefon: 01520 - 3879701<br />E-Mail: info@scheco-design.de</p>

    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>
      With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below,
      users and data subjects have the right
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
        information about the data being processed, further information about
        the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art.
        15 GDPR);
      </li>
      <li>
        to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16
        GDPR);
      </li>
      <li>
        to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17
        DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as
        stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art.
        18 GDPR;
      </li>
      <li>
        to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them
        and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf.
        also Art. 20 GDPR);
      </li>
      <li>
        to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that
        data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of
        data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it
      discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed
      on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this
      obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
      disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information
      about these recipients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to
        object to the controller’s future processing of their data pursuant to
        Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data
        processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong

    </p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>
      Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as
      soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion
      of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or
      unless otherwise stipulated below.

      Customer account/registration
    </h4>
    <p>
      If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use the
      data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your address, or
      your email address) exclusively for services leading up to your potential
      placement of an order or entering some other contractual relationship with
      us, to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to provide customer care
      (e.g. to provide you with an overview of your previous orders or to be
      able to offer you a wishlist function). We also store your IP address and
      the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred
      to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this
      processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The
      data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your customer
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR
      is the legal basis for this processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the
      initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an existing
      contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 Para.
      1 lit. b) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data
      at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to
      do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing
      is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods
      required under tax and commercial law.
